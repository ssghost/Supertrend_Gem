General Settings:

Bot Name:
Give your bot a descriptive name (e.g., "Supertrend BTC/USDT").
Exchange:
Select the exchange where you want to trade.
Pair:
Choose the trading pair (e.g., BTC/USDT). This must match the pair defined in your Python script.
Bot Type:
This is likely to be a "Composite Bot" or a "Signal Bot" depending on your 3commas account level. The important part is that the start condition is set to manual.
Strategy:
This is where the main difference lies. Because the python script generates the signals, the start condition here must be set to "Manual".
2. Deal Settings:

Base Order Size:
Set the amount of your base order. The python script itself does not manage order sizes, so this setting is very important.
Safety Order Size:
Because the python script does not use safety orders, it is suggested to either disable them, or set them to a very low value.
Take Profit:
Configure your desired take-profit percentage. This is independent of the Python script's logic.
Stop Loss:
Very Important: Set a stop-loss percentage to manage risk. The Python script does not include built-in stop-loss functionality.
Start Condition:
Manual: This is the most important setting. The python script will send the signal to 3commas, so the 3commas bot must be set to manual start.
Deal Start Conditions:
Leave this blank.
Cooldown Between Deals:
Set a cooldown period to prevent the bot from opening excessive deals in quick succession.
Max Active Deals:
Limit the maximum number of simultaneously open deals.
Simultaneous Deals Per Same Pair:
Limit the number of deals per pair.
3. Advanced Settings:

Leverage:
If applicable, set your leverage according to your risk tolerance.
Deal Close Condition:
Configure how the deals should be closed. This is in addition to the python script closing deals.
Key Considerations:

Python Script Synchronization:
Ensure that the trading pair and timeframe in your 3Commas bot settings match those in your Python script.
Risk Management:
Pay close attention to stop-loss settings, as the Python script does not handle this.
Backtesting and Testing:
Thoroughly test your bot in paper trading mode before deploying it with real funds.
